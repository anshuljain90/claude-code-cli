in your README.md generated by claude code you will have a section `## Contributing`, replace it with below text

> Note: if you will notice I have mentioned develop branch instead of main, that a personal choice, as I am working on `develop` and pushing code to `main` branch with tags  

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Contributing

### Steps

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add this amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request into develop branch

### Git Commit Best Practices

- **Follow a one-feature/fix/enhancement per branch approach**  
  Work on one logical change at a time. Keep the scope of each branch and commit focused.

- **Commit frequently with detailed messages**  
  Write meaningful commit messages as you make progress. Donâ€™t wait until the end to commit everything at once.

- **If committing a single file, the commit message MUST start with the filename**  

- **Do not mention Claude or any internal/proprietary tools in commit messages**

- **Keep `CHANGELOG.md` updated** : Update the `Unreleased` section continuously as a part of your commits, no need to make seaparate commit if adding anything to `Unreleased` section. Create separate commit for CHANGELOG.md in case creating a tag.

- **Keep `README.md` updated** : if there is any important information in the commit which should reflect in README.md then make the necessary change and add README.md in the same commit

- **Keep `claude.md` updated** : if there is any important information in the commit which should reflect in claude.md then make the necessary change and add claude.md in the same commit

- **Keep swagger updated** : if there is any change in the API contract then make the necessary changes so that swagger UI is always updated. In such cases if APIs become backward in-compatible then major version should be bumped in CHANGELOG.md

- **Keep `NOTICE.md` updated** : if we use/ remove any new third-party project or there is any change in any component of any of the existing third-party projects, that should reflect in NOTICE.md file as a separate commit

- **Structure commit messages properly**  
  Use the following format:
  
  ```
  <type>: <short summary>

  [Optional body with reasoning or context]

  [Optional footer for issue reference, breaking change, etc.]
  ```

  Example:

  ```
  feat: implement user login with JWT

  Adds secure login endpoint and token generation logic.
  Updates validation and error handling.
  ```

- **Use conventional commit types**
  - `feat`: a new feature  
  - `fix`: a bug fix  
  - `docs`: documentation only  
  - `style`: formatting, whitespace, linting  
  - `refactor`: non-functional code changes  
  - `test`: adding or updating tests  
  - `chore`: configuration, build scripts, or tooling

- **Avoid vague or generic messages** : eg. `update`, `stuff`, `misc`  

- **Reference issues or tickets appropriately**  
  Use `Fixes #123`, `Refs #456` in the footer to link commits to issues.

- **Squash or rebase before merge**  
  Clean up local history if needed before merging into `develop`.
